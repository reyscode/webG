# webG

## Problem Statement and Purpose

Web pages are graphs and they should be treated as graphs. 

webG allows you to visualize the DOM tree of any web page as a graph. We currently provide 4 types of visualizations.

- Force Directed
- Random Tree
- Radial Tree
- Cluster



We do not have any tools for visualizing web page as a graph. This project helps to visualize a web page as multiple types of graphs. This project webG basically takes url as input and outputs the graph of the corresponding url in the form of four types of trees.

We do have a python package called *NetworkX* for study of the structure. But the disadvantage of using NetworkX are

-  Its slow
- Rendering output is of low quality and
- Static hence we cannot iterate

This webG project projects the website in the form of four types of graphs namely

1. Force directed graph
2. Random tree
3. Radial Tree
4. Cluster

It also helps to iterate the graph and shows the data contained in each nodes.

This project will be helpful to any projects related to web analysis, scraping etc. The advantage of using web graphs when building or training a model is that we are less likely to miss the import attributes. Hence can create a model with higher efficiency.

## Setup

## Usage



## tools used to solve this problem



1. Flask: to build a web application
2. Elgrapho: Interative visualization
3. Typora for editing markdown



## How to contribute

This project can be extended to to

1. More kinds of graphs 
2. Adjusting the node size dynamically
3. Since vizualising a website as a graph is new idea, I am yet to figure out its applications. Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas.
